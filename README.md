# Friday Night Funkin: Pulse Engine
probably the worst thing i've ever made, Pulse Engine is an engine (no fucking way) that tries to fix FNF. yes, i know that week 8 is out but im doing this while the source code is NOT out.
the original game is in https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin

## Installation Guide
1. install [Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (very importatn!1!1)
2. just enter these commands in the root directory of the project
```
haxelib install flixel
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui
haxelib install hscript
haxelib install newgrounds
haxelib install polymod
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons
```
3. by the way you also need to install Visual Studio 2017 Build tools from [this link](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/67f7bfaa-2635-43d9-ba82-26564f458881/bb057808eeff7d02561cab636b32397e298c3e770ed278602c46d119fa2e4ee8/vs_BuildTools.exe) otherwise you will get an error about "HXCPP_VARS"

## Compiling the game

*ps. you can change the `windows` to anything else, like `linux` or `mac`*
